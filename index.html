                and took a deep breath. </p>
            <p>She waited several minutes watching the numbers above the elevator doors light
                up
                as the elevator moved closer to the ground floor. Once the 1 lit up, the doors opened, and Jane

                Up, up, up, running and spun,<br/>
                the doors open wide on floor 51.<br/>
                "That’s quite courteous," Mr. Grant smiled with pride.<br/>
                He walked out the door, Ms. Rather walked inside.<br/>
                Jane sure was late. It had taken a while,<br/>
                but she greeted Ms. Rather with warmth and a smile.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I’m Ms. Rather and I work with people."
            </p>
            <p>
                “People,” Jane thought and said, “Did you know elevators used to have operators who sat on a stool
                to operate the elevator? Workers need a comfortable place to sit. I’m
                sorry, I’m Jane, and I’m late to the most important meeting I’ve ever had.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well, you seem very calm for a young woman so late to such an important meeting,” Ms. Rather said.

                “You seem oh so calm,” Ms. Rather quite sure.<br/>
                She left Jane alone on the 65th floor.
                 </p>
            <p>
                The many strangers getting on and off the elevator had made Jane too late for her meeting.
            </p>
            <p>
                And then something happened:
            </p>
            <p>
                The sixty-six-floor button once lit so bright<br/>
                blinked off with a buzz and became dark as night.<br/>
                “It’s not meant to be,” Jane tried not to frown.<br/>
                “I just was too late,” she began moving down.<br/>
                Down, down, down, rattle and roar,<br/>
                the doors opened wide on the very first floor.

        A little girl stood at the ground level flight.<br/>
        With rain boots and umbrella striped black and white.<br/>
        She was all alone, the elevator empty.<br/>
        Jane made up her mind and chose to be friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
        But the little girl’s umbrella was stuck in the elevator.</p>
    <p>
        "I have to push the open-door button now, or else she’ll have to walk home in the rain."
        Jane acted quickly to save the umbrella, and one more face in the elevator brightened.
         </p>
    <p>
        "Where are you headed?"<br/>
        The girl stepped through the door.<br/>
        "Thank you, ma'am," said the young girl.<br/>
        "The sixty-sixth floor."
    </p>
    <p>
        "The sixty-sixth floor," Jane thought, "what had she heard?"<br/>
        This little girl must not have gotten the word.<br/>
        Still feeling bad ‘cause her missed interview,<br/>
        she pushed the top button, what else could she do?
    </p>
    <p>
        She said to the little girl:</p>
    <p>
        “I don’t know if you’ll make it up there all the way,<br/>
        but I’ve met some nice people. It’s been a good day.<br/>
        I sure like your stripes with the black and the white.”<br/>
        And the pair’s elevator moved up the next flite.
         </p>
    <p>
        Up, up, up, clatters and clicks, the doors open wide on floor 66.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the sixty-sixth floor, there was a room with a grand mahogany table.</p>
    <p>
        And six chairs.</p>
    <p>
        In each chair sat the Vice President of Air, Rails, and Road for each department in the
        company:</p>
    <p>
        Ms. Wright was in charge of marketing.<br/>
        Mr. Goode was over design.<br/>
        Ms. Rogers controlled accounting.<br/>
        Mr. Grant was chief legal counsel.<br/>
        And Ms. Rather was head of human resources.
         </p>
    <p>
        The girl hugged the man that Jane had yet to greet.<br/>
        “Jane, I’m Mr. Shirley, I’m pleased we can meet.<br/>
        You’ve met my dear little one with the striped hat.<br/>
        You're so kind to help her, you don’t have to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Jane, my friend, we have unanimously decided to make you the president of the Air, Rails and Road
        corporation.
         </p>
    <p>
        “You see, as a creator of ways to travel, we have a problem. Everyone loves the places they go and
        uses
        our planes, trains, and cars to get there. Our job is to make sure they enjoy the ride. The other
        candidates for this job never made it to the sixty-sixth floor, but your compassion, kindness, and
        patience during your journey to our table impressed us all."
    </p>
    <p>
        "President Jane, the job is yours because you enjoy the ride.”
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5">Enjoy the ride.</p>
